1. When on the screen where I can read and send texts to someone, when tapping the "Message" text box, the keyboard pops up like normal but it also moves the Message text box up too far, almost near the top of the screen! I can't see the previous messages when it does this. Might want to rewrite all of the padding or something on this page, because it also goes below my nav buttons on the button of my screen.
2. Handle media messages, like video, audio recordings and photos. Be absolutely sure to incorporate any RCS features to future proof it and for better quality images/videos!
